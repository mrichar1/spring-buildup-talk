  * Selection
  * Queen cells
  * Making up nucs
 * Honey
  * OSR?
  * Strong colonies *at the right times*
  * Liquid or Cut Comb?

* Equipment
 * Clean/sterilise
 * Make up boxes & frames
 * Specialist equipment?

* Bees in spring
 * Cross-over point
 * Food consumption

* Spring Feeding
 * Syrup
  * general survival and wax
 * Pollen
  * brood rearing - bees collecting at entrance
 * Local spring forage
 * Hefting (weight chart)
  * Hive that isn't getting lighter probably doesn't have a laying queen!

* First Inspections
 * Ideally >12C
 * FEdss
 * Seams of bees
 * Merge weak colonies
  * Easier to split a strong colony again later
