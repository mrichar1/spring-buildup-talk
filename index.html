				# Planning for the Season Ahead
				![](img/snow.jpg)
				### Matthew Richardson - 1st March 2021
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring Build Up?
				![](img/flatpack.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Better late than never!
				* Get all your equipment made up now while it is quiet.
				* You can't catch a swarm in a flatpack box!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring Cleaning
				![](img/blowtorch.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Cleanliness is next to Godliness!
				* Clean equipment improves bee health.
				* Easier to work with clean gear - no sticky propolis etc.
				* Cleaning also allows you to spot any needed repairs.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring to Life
				![](img/population.jpg)![](img/winter-feeding.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Things which are Increasing in the hive:
				 * Activity
				 * Brood
				 * Heat
				 * Comb building
				* Things which are Decreasing:
				 * Adult Bees
				 * Stores
				* There is a cross-over point where die-off may outpace brood-rearing!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring Back
				![](img/seasons.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Don't get carried away!
				* The season may not properly start til May
				* Over-eager beekeepers kill colonies
				</section>


				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring into Action!

				![](img/scales.jpg)![](img/syrup.jpg)![](img/pollen.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Starvation always a late-season risk.
				* Hive should always have a minimum of 5kg of stores (15-20kg 'gross')
				* You must feed if low on stores
				* Little and often
				 * Too much can cause chilling and colony can become honeybound
				* Stimulative feeding is a bit of a myth!
				  * Syrup/fondant for energy and comb building
				  * Pollen (rarely needed) for brood rearing
					* Excess brood-rearing risks stress and chilled brood if weather conditions worsen again.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring the Lid
				![](img/crownboard.jpg)

				Notes:
				* First inspections
				 * New/updated record cards
				 * Mid-March to start of April
				 * Above 12C is ideal
				 * Count the seams of bees and check for healthy brood pattern.
				 * Signs of Nosema/dysentry staining?
				 * Minimum interference with the bees themselves!
				 * Food and Egg-laying are key signs to look for
				 * Merge weak colonies
				  * It is easier to split a strong colony later, than try to make 2 weak colonies strong
					* Move into nucs, or pad with insulated dummy boards
				 * Remove mouseguards, clean floors, first varroa count.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Dead Reckoning

				![](img/dead_bee.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Sad, but a good learning opportunity!
				* Try to work out the cause
				* Commonest causes:
				 * Starvation - beekeeper's responsibility
				 * Queen failure - bees' responsibility
				 * Nosema
				* Clean everything thoroughly.
				* If in doubt, throw it out!

				## What Springs to Mind...

				![](img/bees.jpg)![](img/honey.jpg)

				Notes:
				* You can make Bees OR Honey - but not both!
				* Different approaches for each, but same starting points:
				 * Strong, healthy colonies
				 * Spare equipment on hand
				 * A good schedule planned out
				* Be prepared to change your mind!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Spring Honey
				![](img/hives.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Strong colonies at the right time of year (6 weeks from egg to forager)
				* Plenty of spare supers to hand!
				* OSR
				 * Rapid turnaround and extraction
				 * Soft set (creaming)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
				## Full of the Joys of Spring

				![](img/queen-emerge.jpg)

				Notes:
				* Splits, swarms and increase
				 * Selection - choose your best stocks to increase from
				 * Splits
				  * 7-day inspections
					* Decide on method in advance (Pagden, Demaree, Snelgrove etc)
				 * Queen-rearing
				  * Can be as simple as swarm cells, or more complex e.g. grafting
				* Nucs
				 * Split across multiple nucs for increase
				 * Mating nucs for rapid increase (alongside queen-rearing)
