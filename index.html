# Spring Buildup
![](img/snow.jpg)
### Matthew Richardson - 1st March 2021
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Spring Build Up?
![](img/flatpack.jpg)

Notes:
* Better late than never!
* Get all your equipment made up now while it is quiet.
* You can't catch a swarm in a flatpack box!
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Spring Cleaning
![](img/blowtorch.jpg)

Notes:
* Cleanliness is next to Godliness!
* Clean equipment improves bee health.
* Easier to work with clean gear - no sticky propolis etc.
* Cleaning also allows you to spot any needed repairs.
</section>

## Spring to Life
![](img/population.jpg)![](img/winter-feeding.jpg)

Notes:
* Things which are Increasing in the hive:
 * Activity
 * Brood
 * Heat
 * Comb building
* Things which are Decreasing:
 * Adult Bees
 * Stores
* There is a cross-over point where die-off may outpace brood-rearing!
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Spring into Action!

![](img/scales.jpg)![](img/fondant.jpg)![](img/syrup.jpg)

Notes:
* Starvation always a late-season risk.
* You must feed if low on stores
* Little and often
 * Too much can cause chilling and colony can become honeybound
* Stimulative feeding is a bit of a myth!
  * Syrup/fondant for energy and comb building
  * Pollen (rarely needed) for brood rearing
	* Excess brood-rearing risks stress and chilled brood if weather conditions worsen again.

## Spring the Lid
![](img/crownboard.jpg)

Notes:
* First inspections
 * Mid-March to start of April
 * Above 12C is ideal
 * Food and Egg-laying are key signs to look for
 * Count the seams of bees and check for healthy brood pattern.
 * Merge weak colonies
  * It is easier to split a strong colony later, than try to make 2 weak colonies strong
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## What Springs to Mind...

![](img/bees.jpg)![](img/honey.jpg)

Notes:
* You can make Bees OR Honey - but not both!
* Different approaches for each, but same starting points:
 * Strong, healthy colonies
 * Spare equipment on hand
 * A good schedule planned out
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Spring Honey
![](img/hives.jpg)

Notes:
* Strong colonies at the right time of year (6 weeks from egg to forager)
* Plenty of spare supers to hand!
* OSR
 * Rapid turnaround and extraction
 * Soft set (creaming)
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Full of the Joys of Spring

![](img/queen-emerge.jpg)

Notes:
* Splits, swarms and increase
 * Selection - choose your best stocks to increase from
 * Splits
  * 7-day inspections
	* Decide on method in advance (Pagden, Demaree, Snelgrove etc)
 * Queen-rearing
  * Can be as simple as swarm cells, or more complex e.g. grafting
* Nucs
 * Split across multiple nucs for increase
 * Mating nucs for rapid increase (alongside queen-rearing)
